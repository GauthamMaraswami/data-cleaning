inventions and innovations cannnot be done by a machine
Supervised - give both input and output
Un supervised -have only inputs but no output
Reinforcement -Deep learning both are not known
 
learn supervised before deeplearning
workflow:-  Pick up a problem 
			Represent Data
			Apply an algorithm
types
	Clssifications
	Regression:-  predictions
	Clustering:-  divide users into groups based on some coommon attributes
	Recommendations
looking for features in data 
Decision tree problem computation of tree traversal is expensive
always work with the feedback loop
always has to develop
linear Regression linarly incresing data set
gradient descent Least squares minimize the errors
visualization removes outlyers- out of range values
								data to be scrapped
first step of analyzation is visualization
